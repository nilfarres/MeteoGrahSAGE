# GrahMeteoSAGE
This project aims to **determine whether the application of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) can provide a complementary tool that improves the accuracy and predictive capacity of traditional meteorological models in the Catalan Countries**. To achieve this, a rigorous preprocessing of meteorological data from reliable sources covering the period 2016â€“2024 was carried out, applying imputation techniques to handle missing values and converting the information into a format compatible with ***torch_geometric***. Based on these data, a new model named ***GraphMeteoSAGE***, built on the GraphSAGE architecture, was implemented, trained, and validated using data not utilized during training and compared with conventional methods. The integration of GNNs may provide additional relevant insights for the early detection of extreme weather events and the improvement of predictive systems, paving the way for future research in the application of deep learning algorithms to complex environmental challenges.
